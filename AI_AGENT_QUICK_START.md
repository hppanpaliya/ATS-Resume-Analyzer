# AI Agent Quick Start Guide
## How to Use the AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md File

**Purpose:** This guide helps you or an AI coding assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) build the ATS platform step-by-step.

---

## 🎯 What This File Does

The **AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** file:
- ✅ Tracks current state of the codebase
- ✅ Breaks features into manageable chunks
- ✅ Provides step-by-step implementation code
- ✅ Includes checkboxes to track progress
- ✅ Has verification criteria for each feature
- ✅ Links to detailed documentation when needed

---

## 🤖 For AI Coding Assistants

### If using Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, or similar:

**Step 1: Load the Context**
```
Open the project and include AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md in your context window
```

**Step 2: Start with Current State**
```
AI Prompt: "Read AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md and review the current state. What's the next uncompleted feature?"
```

**Step 3: Build Feature-by-Feature**
```
AI Prompt: "Implement Feature 1.1 (Database Setup) following the implementation steps exactly. Test and verify before moving on."
```

**Step 4: Update Progress**
```
AI Prompt: "Mark Feature 1.1 as complete in AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md and update the current state section."
```

**Step 5: Repeat**
```
Continue with next feature until all checkboxes are complete
```

## 👨‍💻 For Manual Development

### If building yourself without AI:

**Use it as your roadmap:**
1. Open `AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Find the first unchecked feature
3. Read the requirements
4. Follow implementation steps
5. Copy code examples
6. Test thoroughly
7. Check the box when done
8. Move to next feature

## 📝 Example AI Prompts

### Starting a New Feature
```
"I'm ready to implement Feature 2.1: Resume Model & CRUD Backend. 
Read the requirements and implementation steps from AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md. 
Create all the necessary files and code."
```

### Getting Help
```
"I'm stuck on Feature 1.2 step 3 (creating auth middleware). 
Check AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md and 03_API_ENDPOINTS.md 
for the correct implementation."
```

### Verifying Completion
```
"I've completed Feature 1.3. Review the verification checklist 
in AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md and test each item. 
Update the checkboxes if all tests pass."
```

### Tracking Progress
```
"Show me the current progress from AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md. 
What percentage of features are complete? What's next?"
```

## 🔄 Workflow Example

**Day 1 - Feature 1.1: Database Setup**

```bash
# Morning
AI: "Read AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md Feature 1.1"
AI: "Install Prisma and dependencies"
AI: "Create schema from 02_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md"

# Afternoon  
AI: "Run migrations and test"
AI: "Mark Feature 1.1 checkboxes as complete"
AI: "Update current state to show Phase 1 in progress"

# End of Day
You: Review code, test manually, commit to Git
```

**Day 2 - Feature 1.2: Authentication Backend**

```bash
# Morning
AI: "Start Feature 1.2 from AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md"
AI: "Create AuthService with registration and login"

# Afternoon
AI: "Create auth middleware and routes"
AI: "Test with curl commands from instructions"
AI: "Mark checkboxes and update progress"

# End of Day
You: Test authentication flow, commit
```

## 🎯 Current Progress Tracking

The file includes a **Current Progress Tracker** section:

```
PHASE 1: FOUNDATION
├─ [✅] Feature 1.1: Database Setup
├─ [✅] Feature 1.2: Authentication Backend  
├─ [⬜] Feature 1.3: Authentication Frontend
└─ Status: IN PROGRESS
```

**Update this as you go:**
- ✅ = Complete
- ⬜ = Not started
- 🔄 = In progress

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If AI gets confused:**
```
"Reset context. Read only AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md section for 
Feature X.X. Follow the implementation steps exactly."
```

**If tests fail:**
```
"Check the verification checklist for Feature X.X. 
What did I miss? Review the testing section."
```

**If stuck on a feature:**
```
"Read the documentation link for Feature X.X. 
Check [relevant doc file] for more details."
```
